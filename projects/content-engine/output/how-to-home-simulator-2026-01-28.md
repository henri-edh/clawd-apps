# How to Build a Home Golf Simulator Under $5,000

Building a home golf simulator doesn't have to cost $20,000+. With smart choices, you can create a professional-quality setup for under $5,000. Here's exactly how to do it.

## What You'll Need

**Essential Equipment:**
- FlightScope Mevo+ ($1,999)
- Hitting mat and turf ($300)
- Impact screen ($250)
- 1080p projector ($500)
- E6 CONNECT software ($500)
- Golf net ($300)
- iPad/tablet for display (existing)
- **Total: ~$3,850**

## Step 1: Choose Your Launch Monitor

The foundation is your launch monitor. For under $5,000 total, we recommend FlightScope Mevo+. It delivers professional-grade 3D Doppler radar accuracy for $1,999—leaving plenty of budget for the rest.

**Top Options Under $2,000:**
- **FlightScope Mevo+ ($1,999)**: Professional 3D Doppler radar, full data suite
- **FlightScope Mevo Gen2 ($999)**: Entry point with accurate ball data
- **SkyTrak ($1,995)**: Camera-based indoor system

**For Serious Setups:**
- **FlightScope i4 ($3,999)**: Professional grade, full club data

## Step 2: Design Your Space

A 10ft x 12ft space is ideal, but 10ft x 10ft works too. Clear out the area, remove obstacles, and ensure you have at least 9ft of ceiling height for your swing.

### Space Requirements
- Minimum width: 10ft
- Minimum depth: 12ft
- Minimum height: 9ft
- Ideal: 12ft x 14ft x 10ft

### Lighting
- Diffuse lighting preferred
- Avoid direct glare on screen/launch monitor
- Warm white LED strips work well

### Flooring
- Hitting mat: Essential for protecting your floors
- Turf or golf carpet for realistic feel
- Putting green area if space allows

## Step 3: Choose Your Software

E6 CONNECT by FlightScope integrates seamlessly with Mevo+. For $500/year, you get access to thousands of courses and realistic gameplay. The Golf Club 2019 is also excellent and works with Mevo+.

### Top Options
1. **E6 CONNECT** (by FlightScope): Full integration with Mevo+
2. **The Golf Club 2019**: Comprehensive simulation
3. **Perfect Golf**: Wide selection of courses
4. **Creative Golf**: Good value, course variety

### Mobile App Option
- E6 CONNECT app lets you play courses on iOS/Android
- Requires only Mevo+ and your phone/tablet

## Step 4: Setup Your Screen/Projector

An impact screen costs around $250 and handles the ball well. Pair it with a 1080p projector for $500. Mount the projector 8-10ft from the screen for the best image size.

### Screen Options
- **Hitting Screen**: Durable, reflects projector well
- **Impact Screen**: Quieter, expensive
- **White Wall**: Cheapest, need to be smooth

### Projector Options
- **4K Projector**: Sharp image, expensive
- **1080p Projector**: Good balance of price/quality
- **Throw Distance**: Match to your room depth

### Setup Tips
- Projector distance: 8-12ft from screen
- Mount at correct height for your hitting zone
- Keystone correction for straight image

## Step 5: Connect Your Launch Monitor

Place your Mevo+ 4-6ft directly behind your hitting zone. Ensure it's level using the built-in bubble level. Connect via Bluetooth to E6 CONNECT or your preferred simulator software.

### FlightScope Mevo+ Setup
1. Position Mevo+ 4-6ft behind ball on hitting mat
2. Level the device (includes level in box)
3. Connect to E6 CONNECT or Golf Club 2019
4. Test with a few shots to verify data
5. Adjust position if needed for accurate reads

### Calibration
- Follow manufacturer instructions exactly
- Check firmware is updated
- Verify no interference from other electronics

## Step 6: Fine-Tune Your Experience

Start with E6 CONNECT's tutorial to learn the interface. Practice on easier courses first. Track your improvement using Mevo+'s data over time.

### Audio
- External speakers for immersion
- Golf-specific sound effects optional

### Seating
- Comfortable chair at correct distance
- Can swivel to watch ball flight on screen

### Organization
- Club storage nearby
- Ball retriever or multiple balls ready
- Scorecard or pen for tracking
